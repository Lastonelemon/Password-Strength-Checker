# Personal Finance Tracker - Project Statement

## Problem Statement

Many students and young professionals struggle to manage their daily expenses and often find themselves overspending without realizing where their money goes. Traditional budgeting apps are either too complex, require bank account linking, or come with subscription fees. There is a need for a simple, offline, and privacy-focused tool that helps individuals track their spending habits, categorize expenses, and maintain financial awareness without compromising personal data.

## Scope of the Project

This project aims to develop a lightweight Personal Finance Tracker application using Python. The system will allow users to record daily transactions, categorize expenses, view spending summaries, and analyze their financial patterns over time. The application will operate entirely offline, ensuring complete data privacy, and will store all information locally on the user's device.

The project emphasizes simplicity, ease of use, and practical financial insights that can help users make informed spending decisions and develop better money management habits.
